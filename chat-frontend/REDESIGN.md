# Weezevent-Inspired UI Redesign

## Overview
The chat frontend has been completely redesigned to match Weezevent's brand identity and modern design principles. The new design features a clean, professional interface with Weezevent's signature electric blue color (#0033FF) as the primary brand color.

## Design Philosophy
